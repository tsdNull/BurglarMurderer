# What is this?
BurglarMurderer is a basic chatbot for Discord, designed purely to be a dice roller for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.

# How do I roll dice with this?
Well, You can check this within Discord using the "!help" command to bring up the full list of the bot's commands, or using "!help <command>" to pull up the full info on a specific command.

As you're here though, here is the full list and usage as of the latest version:

!roll 2d6 - rolls 2d6 and displays the results and the total.
!rollstats - 6x 4d6, dropping the lowest of each set, displays the totals.  
!attack (-a or -d) 2d8 - rolls a d20 for attack (with advantage/with disadvantage), rolling 2d8 for damage at the same time.  
!skill - rolls a d20 for a skill check.
